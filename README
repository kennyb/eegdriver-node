I'm essentially ripping off the code of NeuroServer for now until I do a complete rewrite.

hopefully this becomes useful to someone :)

TODO:

1. static variables are used making it impossible to be anything more than a singleton. make these local properties
2. figure out the channels and shit2. 
3. implement the other types of input found in NeuroServer
